Gated Station Entries

Unscaled station entries for gated MBTA subway, Silver Line and light rail stations by service date and 15-minute period. 

A service date is defined as 3:00AM – 26:59AM (2:59AM the next day).

An entry is measured as a successful smart card tap or ticket insertion recorded at a faregate.

Entries are unscaled and so do not take into account non-interaction with the fare gate (e.g. children or other free passengers, fare evasion, etc.). 

Entries are only provided for times when the station is open. 

Employee taps are included in this data. 

This data does not represent total ridership at a station. 

Faregates are held open at times for special events or emergencies and entries are not captured accurately during those times.

Files are separated by calendar year for previous years, and by month for the current calendar year.
